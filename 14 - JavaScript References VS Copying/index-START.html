    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;
   // console.log(players, team);

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

	 const wes = {
		 name: 'Wes',
		 age: 100,
		 social: {
			 twitter: {
			 	personal: "wes bos",
             work: "web bos"
          },
			 facebook: 'wesbos.developer',
		 }
	 };

	 console.profile("spread");
	 const spreadTime = {...wes};
	 console.profileEnd;

    console.time("rich man");
	 const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
	 console.timeEnd("rich man");

    console.time("poor man");
	 const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
	 console.timeEnd("poor man");

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
